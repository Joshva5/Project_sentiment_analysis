# SENTIMENT ANALYSIS IN CARDIO MEDICATION PREDICTION USING NLP
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain a leading cause of mortality worldwide, necessitating effective monitoring and timely intervention. Sentiment analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP) can aid in predicting medication needs by analyzing patient feedback, doctorâ€™s notes, and health-related discussions. This study applies sentiment analysis techniques, including TextBlob and VADER, to classify patient sentiments into three categories: Medication Required, No Medication Required, and Requires Careful Observation.
The model leverages machine learning and NLP techniques to process textual data, extracting relevant features to assess sentiment polarity and intensity. The results are evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, comparing the performance of different sentiment analysis models. Additionally, visualization techniques, such as bar charts and word clouds, provide insights into sentiment distributions.
